            José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda, more popularly known as José Rizal, was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary. He is widely regarded as the national hero of the Philippines due to his pivotal role in inspiring the Filipino people's fight for independence from Spanish colonial rule in the late 19th century. Rizal's most significant contributions were his writings, which called for reform and social change, as well as his advocacy for peaceful resistance against the oppressive Spanish regime. Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal was a brilliant intellectual and polymath, excelling in multiple fields such as medicine, writing, philosophy, and the arts. He was a staunch advocate for education and believed that enlightenment through knowledge was key to achieving national freedom. His two novels, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, exposed the social injustices inflicted upon Filipinos by the Spanish authorities and clergy. These works ignited a sense of national consciousness and fueled the desire for change among Filipinos. Despite being an advocate for peaceful reform, Rizal was arrested by Spanish authorities, accused of inciting revolution. On December 30, 1896, he was executed by a firing squad at Luneta, Manila, but his death became a rallying point for the Philippine Revolution. Today, Rizal’s legacy endures as a symbol of freedom, intellect, and unwavering commitment to justice.
